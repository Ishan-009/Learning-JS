// Coding Challenge #1

/* 
Let's build a simple poll app!

A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter object below.

Here are your tasks:

1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The method does 2 things:
  1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the selected option. The prompt should look like this:
        What is your favourite programming language?
        0: JavaScript
        1: Python
        2: Rust
        3: C++
        (Write option number)
  
  1.2. Based on the input number, update the answers array. For example, if the option is 3, increase the value AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes sense (e.g answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string' or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1". 
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 'registerNewAnswer' method call.

HINT: Use many of the tools you learned about in this and the last section ğŸ˜‰

BONUS: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do NOT put the arrays in the poll object! So what shoud the this keyword look like in this situation?  

BONUS TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 3]
BONUS TEST DATA 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]

GOOD LUCK ğŸ˜€

const poll = {
  question: "What is your favourite programming language?",
  options: ["0: JavaScript", "1: Python", "2: Rust", "3: C++"],
  // This generates [0, 0, 0, 0]. More in the next section ğŸ˜ƒ
  answers: new Array(4).fill(0),

  registerNewAnswer() {
    const userInput = parseInt(
      prompt(` What is your favourite programming language?
              0: JavaScript
              1: Python
              2: Rust
              3: C++`)
    );

    // Precheck wrong output condidtion check
    if (!typeof userInput === "number" && userInput >= 0 && userInput <= 3) {
      console.log(
        "Option Should be a Number and it should be between the range 0-3"
      );
      return;
    }

    this.answers[userInput]++;

    this.displayResults();
  },
  displayResults(
    type = "array" // default parameter type
  ) {
    if (type === "string") {
      console.log(`Poll Results are ${this.answers}`);
    }
    console.log(this.answers);
  },
};

const button = document.querySelector("button.poll");
button.addEventListener("click", poll.registerNewAnswer.bind(poll)); // binding this keyword to the custom this object that we want it point, here as we are calling event listener on button , the thsi keyword points to the button object

// VVIMP

// BONUS: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do NOT put the arrays in the poll object! So what shoud the this keyword look like in this situation?

// BONUS TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 3]
// BONUS TEST DATA 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]

poll.registerNewAnswer.call({ answer: [5, 2, 3] });

// if we had directly had call the method it would have used its own answers property of the object, but by using call we kind of reupdated the answers property by stating it is pointing to our custom answers property

// so we can call the method with different set of input as compared to the object actual property to test out certain scenarios
